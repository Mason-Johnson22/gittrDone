While browsing the web with my son, who is aged 9, i came across this ad for this fortnite,and my son started screaming 'papa please download it is good game!!!!' After downloading it, i was immediatly flooded with ads and porn, and had to reinstall windows. After that though, i got the official download and my son started playing it. Soon, i started hearing strange voices coming from the monitor whenever i let him play. Some of the things they said was 'Come the frick over here and revive me you fricker!' I also heard little kids arguing with there parents and this one women accusing this guy of this thing called 'rope'. Whatever, I stray from the point. After awhile, he started doing these strange dances that perplexed be, and started calling me a 'noobmaster69' and a 'default'. As a concerned parent, I do not know what to do, he has also started begging me for this 'battlepass' and when i said no he started doing this dance called the floss and told me that I am not a good builder.
